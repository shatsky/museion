# Structure of result item is such that ['flags'][set_key] does not get a new set_key when ['sets'][set_key] does (e. g., 'uothors' moved to 'poets')
# "Guess authors set_key from authors people categories" code doesn't seem to be executed; more exactly, database call in all_in_category doesn't
#  fixed: problem was names which weren't formatted as needed, because "for n in arr: n=<expr>" doesn't change original n instance in arr in Python
# Set keys and categories should be in one form to simplify code, currently keys are in plural ('poets') and categories in single ('poets')
#  fixed
# Cannot remove items from list in loop, because in-place list modification breaks iteration
#  fixed: for item in list(list) iterates over a temporary copy of list, allowing to modify original instance
# Something wrong with quoted parts in description string, seems to deal with pypasring
#  fixed: simply threw pyparsing out
# If there is explicitly given subject person in authors, that's either poet or composer, it can mean that here it's both poet and composer
# see http://vale-patrushev.narod.ru/wesennem-lesu.mp3 for example
#  fixed: done in authors placement heuristics
# Relations structure: instead of just deleting strings of resolved names, we need to pass them to database import code, so that it can delete
# ext_unknown_name relations which can be existing from previous runs, when these names were unknown
# it would also be nice to be able to remove "names" that are not really names (e. g. 'из к/ф ...') but were treated as names on a previous run
# and added to ext_unknown_name
#  fixed: people_filtered
# Instrumental case: what should we do if we don't have a replacement for instrumental name form?
#  just leave it there, add prefix
# 'е'/'ё' insensitivity
